## Install Packages

`Side Note: Packages given is what I prefer using globally and locally with Python i.e Anaconda...`
`The reason all my packages is to show whats available and Many more:`
$ pip install requirements.txt
`To reduce you can reduce`
`pip install (each): streamlit, spacy, gensim, sumy`
`i.e pip install streamlit`
`if spacy is installed the following is important`
$ python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm `(English language usage with spacy as small for load time, quantities can vary, there are larger datasets)`
`Great thing about Python is global packages can be use through out any app and you just filter what is needed...for another episode: Also some packages are manually setup per app like with any language i.e Node JS`

## Starting the app

$ streamlit run app.py
